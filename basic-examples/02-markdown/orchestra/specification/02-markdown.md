| abstract   | An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a particular financial instrument, organised by price level, that shows the available quantities of the instrument at each price point. It provides a real-time view of market depth and liquidity, helping participants understand supply and demand dynamics, and is commonly used in exchanges to facilitate transparent and efficient trading. This example specification defines a set of messages for the effective management of an order book, including messages for adding, modifying, and canceling orders. It also includes messages for reporting key market statistics, such as volume, price levels, and order book depth, to provide insights into market trends and liquidity. |
