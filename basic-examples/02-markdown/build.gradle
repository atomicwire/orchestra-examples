This example demonstrates authoring an Orchestra spec from scratch using Markdown. Like the previous example, this spec
can be used in applications and have other artifacts created from it.

Run `./gradlew :basic-examples:02-markdown:printSpecLocation` to print the location where the built spec can be found.
